# shader-park-touchdesigner
Render Shader Park sculptures in TouchDesigner
### Getting Started ðŸŽ‰
Working files are available in the dist folder.
1) Unzip shader-park-core.zip (Mac users right click on ```shader-park-td-macos``` click Open to give TD access to run the executable).
2) Open up Shader Park TD.toe and have fun.
3) Write your Shader Park code in a text DAT and attach it to the Shader_Park_Core component to render (note there are examples and a render network already set up for you to experiment with).


### Adding Uniforms / Inputs
If you use any input in your Shader Park code eg:
```javascript
let size = input();
```
You will need to add a uniform with the same name (in this case ```size```) to the Vectors tab of the pbr2GLSL1 GLSL MAT.
